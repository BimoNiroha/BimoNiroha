# Working notes

- Start with a minimal version before polishing.

- Share only what feels stable and useful.

- Organize files so future you can still follow.

- Leave short comments where intent is not obvious.

- Capture small ideas before they are forgotten.

- Keep experiments isolated from stable code.

- Document what was learned, not just what was done.

- Revisit old notes to see how thinking evolved.

- Keep side projects small enough to finish.

- Organize files so future you can still follow.

- Leave short comments where intent is not obvious.
